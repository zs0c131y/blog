## About Me

I'm a BCA student at CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, with a passion for web development and cybersecurity. I specialize in full-stack development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

My experience extends beyond coding – I've contributed to Telegram Messenger as a support team member and beta tester, and I've written blogs for Signal's language love campaign. This diverse background helps me create user-centric solutions.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring cybersecurity, working on sound engineering projects, or creating graphic designs. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on innovative projects.
